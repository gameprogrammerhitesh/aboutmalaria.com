International funding for malaria control has risen steeply in the
past decade. Disbursements reached their highest ever levels in 2009
at US$ 1.5 billion, but new commitments for malaria control appear
to have stagnated in 2010, at US$ 1.8 billion. Countries with smaller
populations at risk continue to receive more funding per person at risk
than more populous countries. The amounts committed to malaria,
while substantial, still fall short of the resources required for malaria
control, estimated at more than US$ 6 billion for the year 2010.
The increased financing has resulted in tremendous progress in
increasing access to insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) in the
past 3 years. By the end of 2010, approximately 289 million ITNs will
have been delivered to sub-Saharan Africa, enough to cover 76% of
the 765 million persons at risk of malaria. It is estimated that 42% of
households in Africa owned at least one ITN in mid-2010, and that
35% of children slept under a ITN. The percentage of children using
ITNs is still below the WHA target of 80% partly because up to the end
of 2009, ITN ownership remained low in some of the largest African
countries. Low rates of use reported in some surveys are primarily
due to a lack of sufficient nets to cover all household members;
household survey results suggest that most (80%) of the available
ITNs are used.
While the rapid scale-up of ITN distribution in Africa represents an
enormous public health achievement, it also represents a formidable
challenge for the future in ensuring that the high levels of coverage are
maintained. The lifespan of a long-lasting ITN is currently estimated
to be 3 years. Nets delivered in 2006 and 2007 are therefore already
due for replacement, and those delivered between 2008 and 2010
soon will be. Failure to replace these nets could lead to a resurgence
of malaria cases and deaths.
IRS programmes have also expanded considerably in recent years,
with the number of people protected in sub-Saharan Africa increasing
from 13 million in 2005 to 75 million in 2009, corresponding to
protection for approximately 10% of the population at risk in 2009.
Current methods of malaria vector control are highly dependent
on a single class of insecticides, the pyrethroids, which are the most
commonly used compounds for IRS and the only insecticide class
used for ITNs. The widespread use of a single class of insecticides
increases the risk that mosquitoes will develop resistance, which
could rapidly lead to a major public health problem. The risk is of
particular concern in Africa, where insecticidal vector control is being
deployed with unprecedented levels of coverage and where the
burden of malaria is greatest.
WHO now recommends that all cases of suspected malaria be
confirmed with a diagnostic test prior to treatment. As the incidence
of malaria decreases through much of sub-Saharan Africa, the need
to differentiate malaria from non-malarial fevers becomes more
pressing. The proportion of reported cases in Africa confirmed with
a diagnostic test has risen substantially from less than 5% at the
beginning of the decade to approximately 35% in 2009, but low
rates persist in the majority of African countries and in a minority of
countries in other regions. A small number of countries have shown
that it is possible to scale up rapidly the availability of malaria diagnostic
testing on a national scale, provided that attention is given to
adequate preparation, training, monitoring, supervision and quality
control. Such experiences have been linked with large savings in
the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) and with
improved malaria surveillance.
Information from manufacturers indicates that the number of
ACTs procured has increased in every year since 2005. By the end of
2009, 11 African countries were providing sufficient courses of ACTs
to cover more than 100% of malaria cases seen in the public sector;
a further 8 African countries delivered sufficient courses to treat
50%–100% of cases. These figures represent a substantial increase
since 2005, when only 5 countries were providing sufficient courses
of ACT to cover more than 50% of patients treated in the public
sector. However, information on access to treatment is generally
incomplete, particularly for the significant proportion of patients
treated in the private sector.
The use of oral artemisinin-based monotherapies threatens
the therapeutic life of ACTs by fostering the spread of resistance to
artemisinins. By November 2010, 25 countries were still allowing
the marketing of these products and 39 pharmaceutical companies
were manufacturing them. Most of the countries that still allow the
marketing of monotherapies are located in the African Region and
most of the manufacturers are in India.
The spread of resistance to antimalarial medicines over the past
few decades has led to an intensification of efficacy monitoring to
allow early detection of resistance. Despite the observed changes
in parasite sensitivity to artemisinins, the clinical and parasitological
efficacy of ACTs has not yet been compromised, even in the Greater
Mekong sub-region. Nonetheless, both components of the drug
combination are currently at risk and using an ACT with an ineffective
partner medicine can increase the risk of development or spread
of artemisinin resistance.
A total of 11 countries and one area in the WHO African Region
showed a reduction of more than 50% in either confirmed malaria
cases or malaria admissions and deaths in recent years. A decrease of
more than 50% in the number of confirmed cases of malaria between
2000 and 2009 was found in 3 of the 56 malaria-endemic countries
outside Africa, while downward trends of 25%–50% were seen in 8
other countries. Morocco and Turkmenistan were certified by the
Director-General of WHO in 2010 as having eliminated malaria.

xii WORLD MALARIA REPORT 2010
In 2009, the European Region reported no locally acquired cases
of P. falciparum malaria for the first time.
It is estimated that the number of cases of malaria rose from 233
million in 2000 to 244 million in 2005 but decreased to 225 million
in 2009. The number of deaths due to malaria is estimated to have
decreased from 985 000 in 2000 to 781 000 in 2009. Decreases in
malaria burden have been observed in all WHO Regions, with the
largest proportional decreases noted in the European Region,
followed by the Region of Americas. The largest absolute decreases
in deaths were observed in Africa.
While progress in reducing the malaria burden has been remarkable,
there was evidence of an increase in malaria cases in 3 countries
in 2009 (Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, and Zambia). The reasons
for the resurgences are not known with certainty. The increases in
malaria cases highlight the fragility of malaria control and the need
to maintain control programmes even if numbers of cases have been
reduced substantially. The experiences in Rwanda and Zambia also
indicate that monthly monitoring of disease surveillance data, both
nationally and subnationally, is essential. Since many countries in
sub-Saharan Africa had inadequate data to monitor disease trends,
it is apparent that greater efforts need to be made to strengthen
routine surveillance systems. Major epidemiological events could be
occurring in additional countries without being detected and investigated.
